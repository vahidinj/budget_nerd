# Production (API-only) dependencies.
#
# Slimmed for Elastic Beanstalk to avoid large wheels (torch, torchvision, scipy stack)
# that were previously pulled indirectly via sentence-transformers / visualization libs.
#
# Optional extras (NOT installed by default on EB):
#   backend/requirements-ai.txt   -> sentence-transformers (pulls torch ~900MB)
#
# To enable AI categories with OpenAI locally:
#   export USE_AI_CATEGORIES=1
#   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
#
# If you accidentally need everything (local dev only):
#   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt -r backend/requirements-ai.txt
#
# Pinned versions retained for reproducibility. Update deliberately.
